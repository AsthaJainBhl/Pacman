Pacman Game üéÆ
A simple Pacman game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates fundamental game development concepts, including grid-based layouts, dynamic rendering, event handling, and collision detection.

Features
1. Grid-Based Gameplay: The game grid dynamically adjusts based on the layout array, supporting customizable levels.
2. Pacman Movement: Control Pacman with arrow keys to navigate the grid and eat pac-dots.
3. Ghosts with AI: Ghosts move autonomously in random directions, avoiding walls and chasing Pacman.
4. Score Tracking: Keep track of your score as Pacman eats pac-dots and power-pellets.
5. Power Pellets: Temporarily scare ghosts when Pacman consumes power-pellets.
6. Dot Style Toggle: Customize the appearance of pac-dots (dots or dashes) with an interactive dropdown menu.
7. Game Over Detection: Detect collisions between Pacman and ghosts to end the game.

How to Play
  Open the game in your browser by running index.html.
  Use arrow keys to move Pacman:
  Left: ‚Üê
  Up: ‚Üë
  Right: ‚Üí
  Down: ‚Üì
  Navigate the grid to eat pac-dots and avoid ghosts.
  Collect power-pellets to scare ghosts and earn bonus points.

Technologies Used
  HTML: For structuring the game layout and elements.
  CSS: For styling the game, including walls, dots, and Pacman.
  JavaScript: For game logic, movement, scoring, and ghost AI.
  
Future Enhancements
  Add multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
  Implement ghost AI that intelligently tracks Pacman.
  Introduce a high-score leaderboard.
Enhance visual and sound effects for a richer gaming experience.
